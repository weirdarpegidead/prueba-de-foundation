<h2>Functions &amp; Mixins</h2>
<h3 class="subheader">Take advantage of some handy functions we built into Foundation or customize our mixins to make your own component styles. We've included visibility functions and color theming as well.</h3>

<hr>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<h4>Is It Light?</h4>

<p>This function takes a background color, and returns an appropriate foreground color based on if the background is light or dark.</p>

<hljs>
.component {
  $bg: dodgerblue;
  background: $bg;
  // By default, the function returns black if the background is light, or white if the background is black
  color: isitlight($bg);
  // However, you can override this. The first parameter is the dark color to return, while the second parameter is the light color
  color: isitlight($bg, #333, #ccc);
}
</hljs>

<h4>Smart Scale</h4>

<p>This function takes a color, and makes it darker if the color is light, or lighter if the color is dark. We use this function to create appropriate offset colors for components.</p>

<hljs>
.component {
  background: dodgerblue;
  // Adjust the intensity of the scaling by adding a percentage value after the color. 5% is the default
  border: 1px solid smartscale(dodgerblue, 10%);
}
</hljs>

<h4>rem Calculation</h4>

<p>Rems are very useful, but thinking in rems can be hard. Our rem calculation function will convert a pixel value to the correct rem value, based on the base font size of the document.</p>

<hljs>
.component {
  font-size: rem-calc(20); // = 1.25rem
}
</hljs>

<hr>

<h3>Mixins</h3>

<h4>CSS Triangle</h4>

<p>Generates a CSS triangle, for use as a dropdown arrow, modal tail, or anything you can think of.</p>

<hljs no-escape>
.component {
  &::after {
    @include css-triangle(
      $triangle-size: 10px, // Size of the triangle
      $triangle-color: red, // Color of the triangle
      $triangle-direction: top // Orientation of the triangle; can be top, right, bottom, or left
    );
  }
}
</hljs>

<h4>Clearfix</h4>

<p>If you have an element that only contains floated elements, you'll need to add a clearfix to give the container proper height.</p>

<hljs>
.component {
  @include clearfix;
  
  .floaty-thing {
    float: left;
  }
}
</hljs>
