<h2>Popup</h2>

<h3 class="subheader">A window that has content and can be placed anywhere, like a popup. Trigger it when a view is loaded or from a button click.</h3>

<hr>

<style>
  .padding { padding: 1rem; }
</style>

<h3>Basic HTML</h3>

<p>You can create popup with this basic directive</p>

<div class="grid-block">
  <div class="small-12 medium-6 grid-content">
<hljs>
<a class="button" href="#" zf-popup-toggle="popup">Open Popup</a>
<zf-popup id="popup" class="padding">
  <!-- Popup content -->
</zf-popup>
</hljs>
  </div>
  <div class="small-12 medium-6 grid-content">
    <a class="button" href="#" zf-popup-toggle="popup-2">Open Popup</a>
    <zf-popup id="popup-2" class="padding">
      <p>If the girl you love moves in with another guy once, it's more than enough. Twice, it's much too much.  Three times, it's the story of your life.</p>
    </zf-popup>
  </div>
</div>

<hr>

<h3>Positioning</h3>

<p>Popups use a library called Tether. Tether attaches an element to another element with absolute positioning; however, there is one caveat. If your popup is nested within a scrollable area (not `body`) but it's not the immediate parent of that element, it will lose its positioning.</p>

<h3>Sass Mixins</h3>

<p>Popups don't currently have any sizing classes, but you can use our mixins to style your own.</p>

<hljs>
.custom-popup {
  // Use this mixin to override the default styles for panels
  @include popup(
    $width: $popup-width, // Should be an absolute value like px or rem
    $background: $popup-background, // Background color
    $radius: $popup-radius, // Border radius
    $shadow: $popup-shadow, // Box shadow
    $border: $popup-border // Border
  );
}
</hljs>

<h3>Sass Variables</h3>

<p>Use these variables to customize the appearance of popups.</p>

<hljs include="'partials/scss/popup.html'" language="scss">
</hljs>
