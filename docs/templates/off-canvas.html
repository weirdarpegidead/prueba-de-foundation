<h2>Off-canvas</h2>
<h3 class="subheader">A container that is hidden off-screen and pushes its way in view when needed. It can be opened from the top, bottom, right, or left of the screen.</h3>

<hr>

<a class="button" href="#" zf-hard-toggle="example-canvas-top">Open Top Off-canvas</a>
<a class="button" href="#" zf-hard-toggle="example-canvas-right">Open Right Off-canvas</a>
<a class="button" href="#" zf-hard-toggle="example-canvas-bottom">Open Bottom Off-canvas</a>
<a class="button" href="#" zf-hard-toggle="example-canvas-left">Open Left Off-canvas</a>

<hr>

<h3>Basic HTML</h3>

<p>An off-canvas pane must be placed <em>before</em> the frame of your app. This allows the frame to animate in and out along with the pane.</p>

<hljs>
<zf-offcanvas position="left">
  <!-- Off-canvas content -->
</zf-offcanvas>
<div class="grid-frame">
  <!-- Main app content -->
</div>
</hljs>

<p>The pane can be positioned at the top, right, bottom, or left of the screen with the `position` attribute.</p>

<hljs>
<zf-offcanvas position="left">
</zf-offcanvas>

<zf-offcanvas position="bottom">
</zf-offcanvas>
</hljs>

Add the `zf-open`, `zf-close`, and `zf-toggle` directives to other elements to open and close the off-canvas pane.

<hljs>
<zf-offcanvas id="menu" position="left">
  <a zf-close class="close-button">&times;</a>
  <!-- Modal content -->
</zf-offcanvas>

<a zf-open="menu" class="button">Open Off-canvas</a>
</hljs>

<hr>

<h3>Advanced HTML</h3>

<p>Add the `detached` class to an off-canvas to change how the animation works. Instead of sliding with the frame, the off-canvas pane will stay in place, as the pane slides to reveal the pane.</p>

<hljs>
<zf-offcanvas position="left" class="detached">
</zf-offcanvas>
</hljs>

<p>Lastly, the off-canvas pane supports the coloring classes `primary` and `dark`:</p>

<hljs>
<zf-offcanvas position="left" class="primary">
</zf-offcanvas>
</hljs>

<hr>

<h3>Sass Mixins</h3>

<p>Use the off-canvas mixins to write your own custom classes for this component.</p>

<hljs no-escape>
.custom-off-canvas {
  // Extend the off-canvas selector to get the basic structural styles
  @extend %off-canvas;

  // Use this mixin to set the position and size of the menu
  // The shadow is also included in this mixin; its style will change depending on the position of the pane
  @include off-canvas-layout(
    $position: left, // Can be top, right, bottom, or left
    $size: default, // Can be a px, rem, or em value. "default" will use the values in the settings variables
    $shadow: $offcanvas-shadow // Pass in a shadow value with a Y offset, like 0 2px 10px black
  );

  // Use this mixin to define visual styles for the pane
  @include off-canvas-style(
    $background: $offcanvas-background, // Background color
    $color: $offcanvas-color, // Text color
    $padding: $offcanvas-padding // Padding inside the pane
  );

  &.custom-detached-class {
    // Use this mixin to add the detached visual style
    @include off-canvas-detached;
  }
}
</hljs>
