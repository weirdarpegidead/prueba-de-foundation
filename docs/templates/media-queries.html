<h2>Media Queries</h2>
<h3 class="subheader">CSS media queries allow us to adjust the display and orientation of content at different screen sizes.</h3>

<hr>

<h3>Default Media Queries</h3>

<p>Foundation for Apps has three core breakpoint ranges, which you may recognize from Foundation for Sites.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Small:</strong> any screen.</li>
  <li><strong>Medium:</strong> any screen 640px or wider.</li>
  <li><strong>Large:</strong> any screen 1024px or wider.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many components can be modified at different screen sizes using special <em>breakpoint classes</em>. For example, this HTML creates a menu bar that is vertical on small screens, and horizontal on medium-sized screens and larger.</p>

<hljs language="html">
<ul class="menu-bar vertical medium-horizontal">
  <!-- ... -->
</ul>
</hljs>

<p>The understanding of breakpoints is most important when working with <a ui-sref="grid">the grid</a>, which helps you create your responsive app layouts.</p>

<h3>Changing the Breakpoints</h3>

<p>The names of breakpoints, and their widths, are stored in a <code>$breakpoints</code> variable in your settings file.</p>

<hljs language="scss">
$breakpoints: (
  small: rem-calc(0),
  medium: rem-calc(640),
  large: rem-calc(1200),
  xlarge: rem-calc(1440),
  xxlarge: rem-calc(1920),
);
</hljs>

<p>Changing the widths of any of the breakpoints is as easy as changing the pixel values in this map. Note that here there are two extra breakpoints: <code>xlarge</code> and <code>xxlarge</code>. We don't use these for any components, and also don't output any CSS classes that use them by default.</p>

<p>You can change that by modifying the <code>$breakpoint-classes</code> variable in your settings file. This is a list of breakpoint names. Adding or removing names from the list will change the CSS class output. It looks like this by default:</p>

<hljs language="scss">
$breakpoint-classes: (small medium large);
</hljs>

<p>For example, to get <code>xlarge</code> classes in your CSS, for use in the grid, menu bar, and more, just add it to the end of the list:</p>

<hljs language="scss">
$breakpoint-classes: (small medium large xlarge);
</hljs>

<hr>

<h3>The Breakpoint Mixin</h3>

<p>Our <code>breakpoint()</code> mixin makes it easy to write media queries. You can use the named breakpoints or a custom pixel, rem, or em value.</p>

<p>To use the mixin, call it with <code>@include</code>, and then pass in the CSS content you want inside the curly braces.</p>

<hljs language="scss">
.element {
  // Only affects medium screens and larger
  @include breakpoint(medium) {
    // All CSS in here goes inside the media query
  }
}
</hljs>

<p>The behavior of the media query can be changed by adding the keyword <code>down</code> or <code>only</code> after the breakpoint value, separated by a space.</p>

<hljs language="scss">
.element {
  // Only affects medium screens and smaller
  @include breakpoint(medium down) { }

  // Only affects medium screens, not small or large
  @include breakpoint(medium only) { }
}
</hljs>

<p>It's also possible to pass in custom values. You can enter a <code>px</code>, <code>rem</code>, or<code>em</code> valueâ€”in the end, the value will be converted to <code>em</code>.</p>

<hljs language="scss">
.element {
  // Converted to 20em
  @include breakpoint(320px) { }

  // Unitless values are assumed to be pixels
  @include breakpoint(320) { }

  // Converted to 40em
  @include breakpoint(40rem) { }
}
</hljs>

<p>Lastly, there are two special media queries that are not width-based: <code>portrait</code>, <code>landscape</code>, and <code>retina</code>. Using these keywords with the <code>breakpoint()</code> mixin will output a media query for device orientation or pixel density, rather than screen width.</p>

<hljs language="scss">
.element {
  @include breakpoint(landscape) {
    // CSS for landscape-oriented devices only
  }

  @include breakpoint(retina) {
    // CSS for high-resolution displays only
  }
}
</hljs>
